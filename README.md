# WordleClone

This is an app written in .NET MAUI which represents a clone of the popular NY Times game Wordle.

It uses an API to generate a random word as a solution (each round of the game has a new solution) and another API to ensure that the user's inputs are valid and existing word. The definition of the solution is given after the round, as well as the part of speech of the word.

Users can also track their game statistics (number of games played, number of games won, win percentage, average winning row).
